Welcome to my website! This was my practice in HTML/CSS/JS/PHP

To Be Implemented:
  - Contact me section, Github does not support PHP so I will find a different way of sending mail
    - JS: I can take all of the information from input boxes and write it to a text file
  - Update the projects section
  - In project section make left/right scrollable
    - Make the scroll bar hidden so people have to find it by chance
    - Make the unseen section a personal projects/skills section
  - Clean up code. (It's a bit messy, I was still trying to figure it all out)
